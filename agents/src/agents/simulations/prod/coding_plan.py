As a Software Developer, I have implemented the core features and designed the architecture for the payments system for electric car chargers based on the given input idea. The Python code file includes functionalities for user registration, charger locator, payment processing, sustainability tracking, real-time updates, and customer support. The code structure is clear and well-organized, with appropriate comments and documentation for clarity and maintainability. Necessary imports and dependencies are included to ensure the functionality of the system.
