The Battle of Bunker Hill, fought on June 17, 1775, was a significant early conflict in the American Revolutionary War. It took place primarily on Breed's Hill, a fortified position overlooking Boston Harbor. Despite the name, the battle did not occur on Bunker Hill, but it was the original British objective. The battle resulted in a tactical victory for the British, who successfully drove the colonial forces from the hill, but it came at a heavy cost. The colonists' valiant defense and the significant casualties suffered by the British forces demonstrated the determination and military potential of the American revolutionaries. This battle served as an early indication that the war for independence would be long and arduous.
