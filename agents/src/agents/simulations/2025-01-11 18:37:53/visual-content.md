The Great Wall of China is a renowned historical monument that spans over 13,000 miles, making it one of the most extensive man-made structures. It was primarily constructed during the Ming Dynasty, between the 14th and 17th centuries, to protect the empire from northern invasions. The wall is not just a single continuous barrier but a network of walls, towers, and fortifications, built with various materials including stone, brick, and packed earth. Its construction involved millions of workers and is considered one of the greatest engineering feats in history. The Great Wall stands as a symbol of ancient Chinese civilization and has become a significant tourist attraction, offering visitors a glimpse into China's rich cultural heritage.
