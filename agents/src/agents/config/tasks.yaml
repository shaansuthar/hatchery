move_character:
  description: >
    Analyze the current office map data and determine the optimal next move for the character. Based on the given map data, decide where the character should move, considering obstacles, furniture, and people within the space. The objective is to identify a destination that is both logically relevant to the current context (e.g., for a task or interaction) and is achievable based on the layout of the office.

    <MAP_DATA>{map_data}</MAP_DATA>

    <INPUT_IDEA>{idea}</INPUT_IDEA>

  expected_output: >
    A JSON object representing the optimal movement decision:
    - There should be 3 objects: "Marketing", "Software", and "Movement"
    - The "Marketing" and "Software" sections should reflect whether the character should interact with any team members based on proximity or need. The Speech part here reflects what the product manager should say to the respective director.
    - The "Movement" section should contain the x and y coordinates indicating the character's next move.

    Example output:
    {
      "Marketing": {
        "ShouldTalkTo": true,
        "Speech": "We should focus on targeting younger audiences for this campaign."
      },
      "Software": {
        "ShouldTalkTo": false,
        "Speech": "No further updates are required for this module at the moment."
      }
    }
