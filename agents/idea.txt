Pitch: Analog and Mixed-Signal Design for RTL Mastery
Imagine a platform designed to teach and empower individuals to bridge the gap between analog and mixed-signal design and RTL (Register Transfer Level) development for semiconductor chips. This program focuses on providing hands-on, practical experience, blending foundational theory with real-world applications.

The Vision
Develop a learning journey where users:

Start with the basics of analog and mixed-signal design, understanding how these components integrate into chip design.
Progress into RTL development, learning how to translate high-level design into hardware description languages like Verilog or VHDL.
Gain the ability to design and verify entire mixed-signal systems, from analog components to digital control logic.
What Makes It Special
Hands-On Learning: Use simulated environments or actual hardware to practice building and testing circuits and RTL modules.

Step-by-Step Integration: Teach how analog and digital domains converge, covering topics like data converters, clock-domain crossing, and signal integrity.

Industry-Relevant Skills: Prepare users to contribute to semiconductor projects, bridging traditional gaps between analog and digital designers.
